            The Historical Tech Tree is an interactive visualization of technological history, 
            showing how inventions and discoveries throughout human history are connected to each other.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each node in the tree represents a significant technological development, discovery, or 
            invention. The connections between nodes show how technologies built upon or influenced 
            each other. The horizontal axis represents time, spanning from the earliest human tools 
            to modern innovations.

          <p>
            The data for this visualization comes from various historical sources, academic publications, 
            and technological histories. While we strive for accuracy, technology history can be complex 
            and sometimes controversial. Dates and attributions are based on commonly accepted historical 
            records, but may be subject to debate or new discoveries.
