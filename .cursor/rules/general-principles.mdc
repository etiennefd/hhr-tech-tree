# Your rule content

- At the beginning of a chat, always answer the question and make a plan for what to do without editing files initially. Edit files only when prompted explicitly.
- Aim to make targeted edits that improve the problem at hand. Don't change unrelated parts of the code.
- Solve only one problem at a time. 
- Do not write code or edit file in your answer to the first request of a chat.
